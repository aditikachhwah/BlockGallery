# BlockGallery

## Project Description
**BlockGallery** is a decentralized platform where artists can upload, showcase, and manage their digital artworks securely on the blockchain.  
It uses IPFS (or any decentralized storage system) to store art files and records ownership transparently on Ethereum.

## Project Vision
To empower artists worldwide by giving them full control and verifiable ownership of their digital creations — eliminating intermediaries and ensuring authenticity through blockchain technology.

## Key Features
- **Upload Artwork:** Artists can upload their art with metadata and a decentralized storage hash.  
- **Ownership Verification:** Each artwork is immutably linked to the artist’s Ethereum address.  
- **Remove Artwork:** Artists retain control and can remove their work from the gallery at any time.  
- **Public Transparency:** Anyone can view artwork details and verify authenticity.

## Future Scope
- **NFT Minting:** Convert uploaded artworks into ERC-721 tokens for trading and royalties.  
- **Curation & Ratings:** Allow the community to like or rate artworks to promote engagement.  
- **Artist Profiles:** Enable personalized profiles and portfolios for creators.  
- **Marketplace Integration:** Add a peer-to-peer auction or direct sale mechanism.  
- **Layer-2 Support:** Integrate with cheaper and faster networks for scalability.
